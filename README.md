# I created some fake data using random number/name generators. My old job involved handling data like this, but not using SQL. I wanted to see if there was any relationship between denial reasons and whether or not there was a denial. At first glance it seems like the denials are arbitrary, but I guess that's just the insurance industry. Due to HIPAA and the fact that I no longer work for the company, I don't have access to the actual data, but I wanted the columns to be similar to what I would have worked with, hence the fake data.

# I'll be updating this regularly and adding more content to it as I go. I feel like I have a good understanding of SQL, but I don't really know what to do with it yet!
